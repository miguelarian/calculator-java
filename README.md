# Basic Calculator

This is a basic calculator project written in Java as a learning exercise. It includes four basic operations:

+ add
+ sub
+ multiply
+ divide


## Development process 

I followed TDD red-green-blue approach to implement the basic functionality with baby steps ([see commit history](https://github.com/miguelarian/calculator-java/commits/main/)).


## Testing

Unit tests are written using [JUnit 5.8.1](https://junit.org/junit5/).
